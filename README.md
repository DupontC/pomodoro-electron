# Pomodoro App in Electron

![App icon in OSX tray displaying time](screenshots/example.png "Pomodoro app screenshot")

This is a very very basic pomodoro app in electron. 

Code is subject to massive refactoring, this is mostly just a try-out project but I intend to expand on it and clean it up.

## Installation

[Download latest release](https://github.com/veloxy/pomodoro-electron/releases) and install it like any other OSX application. ðŸ˜‹

## Building from source

```
npm install
npm run build
```

## What's next?

- Find a good name!
- Decide if It should be kept simple or if it needs more features.
